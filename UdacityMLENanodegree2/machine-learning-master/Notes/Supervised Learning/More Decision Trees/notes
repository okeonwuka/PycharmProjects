1. sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassier:- Some parameters to this classifier/algorithm
are min_samples_split: this is the minimum no of samples needed at a node
for it to be further split. Default number is 2 samples. This would give a
'very fine' tree in danger of overfitting. Higher numbers give a coarse tree.
